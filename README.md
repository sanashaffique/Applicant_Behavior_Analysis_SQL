# Applicant Behavior Analysis - SQL

## Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts for analyzing applicant behavior data. The project focuses on understanding user interactions, session patterns, and conversion behavior in an application process.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values, renaming columns, and standardizing data types.
- **Duplicate Checks:** Identifying duplicate records at both row and column levels.
- **Session Analysis:** Counting total sessions and unique applicants.
- **Page Analysis:** Number of visits per page and average time spent on each page.
- **Drop-off Points:** Identifying pages and steps where applicants exited the process.
- **Conversion Analysis:** Calculating conversion rates by source and monthly trends.
- **Window Functions Practice:** Using `COUNT() OVER()` and `ROW_NUMBER()` for detailed insights.

## SQL Skills Practiced
- `COALESCE()` for null handling
- `COUNT()` and `AVG()` with `GROUP BY`
- Window functions (`OVER(PARTITION BY ...)`)
- Basic aggregation and ranking
- Data exploration and reporting

## Notes
- This is a **practice exercise** to learn SQL automation techniques.
- Null handling and window functions were emphasized to simulate real-world scenarios.
